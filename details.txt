Face Mesh : this a sub module from the mediapipe libirary 
            mp.solutions is MediaPipeâ€™s solutions module which contain pre-trained models that manipulate
            faces hands ... , and the face_mesh is a spicification for face landmark 
            There is other named face_detection , but it detect just the face not each point in the face
            min_detection_confidence : from 0 to 1 , If the model detects a face with a confidence >= the value,
                it accepts the detection.
            min_tracking_confidence : the same as the last but when face already detected
            max_num_faces : the number max of face will be detected

speak_alert : in my code this function use the pyttsx3 libirary which used for speaking a message for more details :

np.linalg.norm() : you will see this in the code many times , this is a numpy method that allow us to calculate
                    the module of a vector np.linalg.norm()
                    in the code you will see eyePoints[1] - eyePoints[5] or the same thing for mouth 
                    eyePoints[1] is an array (x,y) , array - array = array and the method calculate the module 
                for more details : https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html


Landmark indices for eyes and mouth : in mediapipe the face has more 400 points, so when 
                                     we want to detect each part we should identify points related to it

pygame : is a python libirary for games but you can use the mixer.music to have custom sound (mp3)

cv2.putText : write a text on the image 
                cv2.putText(the frame, the text, the coordinates of the text , the font family, the font scale
                , the color, the thickness of the text)
